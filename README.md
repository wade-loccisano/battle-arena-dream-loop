# Battle Arena Dream Loop

A quick, command-line program implemented in Java that simulates a battle arena. The user is trapped in an infinite dream where
they must fight (by pressing the 'Enter' key) their way to glory!

## Rules

Player gets 10 turns to defeat each enemy.
Player has two stats: Stamina and Panic!
When Stamina reaches 0 or Panic! reaches 20 the game restarts.
Each turn the player 'rolls' a D6 to determine the results of that turn.
The battle never ends!

Monster names are randomly generated from the two arrays in the Monster.java class.
