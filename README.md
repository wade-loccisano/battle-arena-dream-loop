# Battle Arena Dream Loop

A quick, command-line program implemented in Java that simulates a battle arena. The user is dreaming of being trapped in a loop where
they must fight their way to glory! Fighting is done by pressing the 'Enter' key. Easy.

## Rules

* Player gets 10 turns to defeat each enemy.
* Player has two stats: Stamina and Panic! Both begin at 10.
* When Stamina reaches 0 or Panic! reaches 20 you lose and the dream restarts.
* Each turn the player 'rolls' a D6 to determine the results of that turn.
* The battle never ends!

Monster names are randomly generated by the Monster.java class.
